Release 0.1:
• [#8] Security: Fixed a typo that could in some circumstances lead to a
       crash after multiple failed authentication attempts. Thanks,
       Paul Lhussiez.
Development Version:
• Enhancement: Report missing libraries when loading via ctypes
• Security: Check correctly for the result of the
  xcb_grab_{pointer,keyboard} commands
• Security: Limit length of buffered password to prevent memory exhaustion
  (this is a real concern when attacked with custom hardware which
  simulates most rapid keystrokes)
